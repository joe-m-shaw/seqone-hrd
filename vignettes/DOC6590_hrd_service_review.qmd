# Introduction

This is a review of the first year of the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) testing service using the SeqOne SomaHRD pipeline at the Manchester Genomics Laboratory Hub (GLH).

## Timeline and references

- **November 2023:** HRD testing at the North West GLH was performed by sending samples to Myriad Genetics in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.

- **December 2023:** the SeqOne SomaHRD v1.2.0 pipeline was validated for HRD testing ([DOC6192]{custom-style="Strong"}).

- **December 2023:** the SeqOne HRD clinical service began, replacing the Myriad service. DNA was extracted using the Cobas extraction method (Qiagen). Results were entered and reported by GLH scientists on the DNA Database (also known as the DNA Laboratory Information Management System - DLIMS).

- **April 2024:** the QIAsymphony DNA extraction method was validated for use with SeqOne ([DOC6255]{custom-style="Strong"}).

- **April 2024:** results were entered by GLH scientists on the iGene database.

- **April 2024:** SomaHRD was upgraded to v1.2.7 ([INC9110]{custom-style="Strong"}).

- **November 2024:** SomaHRD was upgraded to v1.2.8 ([INC9891]{custom-style="Strong"}).

## Background

"HRD testing" comprises of two tests:

1) Sequence analysis for pathogenic variants in specific genes, including *BRCA1* and *BRCA2*. At the North West GLH, this is performed with Illumina NGS on the PanSolid QIAseq enrichment.

2) Genomic instability testing for genomic copy number variation, which indicates a defective homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway. At the North West GLH, this is performed via shallow whole genome sequencing (WGS) with the SeqOne SomaHRD pipeline.

These two tests are concordant in the majority of cases, however they may give discordant results:

- A sample may have a positive genomic instability score without the presence of a *BRCA1/2* variant. This may be caused by pathogenic variants in other HRR pathway genes, or  a reversion mutation [@konstantinopoulos2015].

- A sample may have a negative genomic instability score with the presence of a *BRCA1/2* variant. This was reported in the original publication of the Genomic Instability Score (GIS) by Myriad Genomics: approximately 5% of *BRCA*-deficient samples in the training dataset had a negative GIS of below 42 [@telli2016]. 

## Aims

The aims of this service review are:

1. To establish the impact of a "borderline" category for SeqOne HRD scores between 0.4 and 0.6.

2. To check the frequency of samples with *BRCA1/2* pathogenic variants that have negative SeqOne HRD scores.

3. The overall range of neoplastic cell contents (NCC) for the samples supplied.

# Methods

## Data sources

Data was collated from the following sources:

- The DNA Database (DLIMS) MicroSoft SQL server, via an ODBC connection. Data was extracted for samples with disease code 204 (tumour BRCA) recieved after 01/12/2023.

- The iGene database, via a custom data export. Data were saved on the MicrosoftSQL server as "Eval_HRD" and accessed using the odbc package.

```{r}
#| label: eval-hrd-connection
#| echo: FALSE

dbi_con <- DBI::dbConnect(
  drv = odbc::odbc(),
  dsn = "moldb")

eval_hrd <- tbl(dbi_con, dbplyr::in_catalog(catalog = "MolecularDB",
                                              schema = "dbo",
                                              table = "Eval_HRD")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  collect()

DBI::dbDisconnect(conn = dbi_con)

```

- Comma separated value (.csv) files downloaded from the SeqOne website: [https://seqone.com/]()

## Analysis

Analysis was performed in R (v4.4.1) and is saved in a [public Github repository](https://github.com/joe-m-shaw/seqone-hrd/tree/hrd_audit).

There are `r nrow(tbrca_seqone_dlims_df_filtered)` samples which have results on DLIMS from both SeqOne HRD testing and *BRCA1/2* sequencing on the PanSolid next generation sequencing panel. Samples with an inconclusive or fail result for either test were excluded. Results were joined by the "labno" field from DLIMS. A sample is classified as having homologous recombination deficiency when the SeqOne score is 0.5 or greater. Three samples were classified as being homologous recombination proficient by SeqOne but were also found to have pathogenic *BRCA1/2* variants (@fig-dlims-plot).

# Conclusion

From this analysis we can make the following conclusions:

1. 8% of samples have SeqOne HRD scores between 0.4 and 0.6.

2. 3 out of 24 samples with *BRCA1/2* pathogenic variants have negative SeqOne HRD scores (`r (3/24)*100` %).

3. 4% of samples have NCC values below 20%.
